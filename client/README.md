# About

This is the client part of Mr Men Memory Match.

The client can ran standalone.

# Deploy

When deployed the leaderboard service url should point to the url given by the hosting provider for the leaderboard service. By default it run on localhost. This means you can use a local version of the leaderboard if you setup the leaderboard service and a database locally. If not, don't bother. The game can be played as is without a leaderboard. Just open the index.html file in a browser of your choice and you should be fine.
